# Data Privacy

The data protection regime in Canada is governed by the following four private sector privacy statutes: 

    > (i) the Federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)
    
    > (ii) Alberta’s Personal Information Protection Act
    
    > (iii) British Columbia’s Personal Information Protection Act
    
    > (iv) Québec’s An Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector (collectively, Canadian Privacy Statutes). While PIPEDA governs the inter-provincial and international collection, use and disclosure of personal information, it also applies to organizations that collect, use and disclose personal information during a commercial activity that takes place within a province. In addition to these four statutes, Canada has also enacted anti-spam legislation (CASL).

The private sector privacy statutes in  Alberta,  British  Columbia,  and  Québec  have  each  been  deemed  “substantially similar” to PIPEDA and, as such, PIPEDA will not 
apply in those jurisdictions. 


PIPEDA, PIPA Alberta and PIPA BC expressly require organisations to  appoint an individual responsible for compliance with the obligations  under the respective statutes.  Such individuals are typically referred  to as the Chief Privacy Officer or Privacy Officer, although Canadian  Privacy Statutes do not prescribe any particular title.
