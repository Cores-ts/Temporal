# Data Privacy

The data protection regime in Canada is governed by the following four private sector privacy statutes: 

    > (i) the Federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)
    
    > (ii) Alberta’s Personal Information Protection Act
    
    > (iii) British Columbia’s Personal Information Protection Act
    
    > (iv) Québec’s An Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector (collectively, Canadian Privacy Statutes). While PIPEDA governs the inter-provincial and international collection, use and disclosure of personal information, it also applies to organizations that collect, use and disclose personal information during a commercial activity that takes place within a province. In addition to these four statutes, Canada has also enacted anti-spam legislation (CASL).

The private sector privacy statutes in  Alberta,  British  Columbia,  and  Québec  have  each  been  deemed  “substantially similar” to PIPEDA and, as such, PIPEDA will not 
apply in those jurisdictions. 


PIPEDA, PIPA Alberta and PIPA BC expressly require organisations to  appoint an individual responsible for compliance with the obligations  under the respective statutes.  Such individuals are typically referred  to as the Chief Privacy Officer or Privacy Officer, although Canadian  Privacy Statutes do not prescribe any particular title.
    > There are no specific sanctions for failure to appoint a Privacy Officer.



There are no specific contractual obligations that must be imposed on  a  processor  providing  cloud-based  services  under  Canadian  Privacy  Statutes.    There  is  an  evolving  set  of  provisions  that  Canadian privacy regulatory authorities would expect to be included  in  contracts  with  cloud-based  or  other  service  providers.   These  include,  among  other  things:  (i)  limitations  on  collection,  use,  disclosure, access and other processing; (ii) appropriate information  security governance; (iii) training and education for service provider  employees with access to personal information; (iv) restrictions on  sub-contracting; (v) audits; (vi) breach notification protocols and (vii) data return, anonymisation or destruction requirements

Each of the Canadian Privacy Statutes contains specific provisions  relating to the safeguarding of personal information.  In essence,  these  provisions  require  organisations  to  implement  reasonable  technical, physical and administrative measures to protect personal  information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorised access,  disclosure, copying, use, modification or destruction.

However, three provinces have their own privacy laws in place that supersede PIPEDA. Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec have provincial private sector privacy laws that have been declared substantially similar to the federal law, thus the provincial laws apply rather than PIPEDA. But, when it comes to interprovincial or international transfers of personal information, PIPEDA will be applicable over the provincial law.

By keeping your data stored on Canadian servers, you are only subject to Canadian privacy laws. If you were to store your data in a cloud platform operated out of the United States for example, then your information would be subject to the US Patriot Act. The US Patriot Act gives government and law enforcement agencies the ability to search data retained by service providers.
