# Temporal (Heavy WIP) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/RTradeLtd/Temporal/api?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/RTradeLtd/Temporal/api)

Temporal is an enterprise-grade storage solution featuring an easy to consume API that can be re-used for a variety of applications, initially paid-for-pinning of IPFS content, and a personal cloud storage solution backed by IPFS. Soon after the MVP functionality will be expanded to connect into the Ethereum swarm network, and private IPFS swarms/clusters. Followed up plugging into STORJ and SIA. Ultimately the final product will be an enterprise ready API to allow organizations to use these distributed storage protocols in their own products. This API will be backed by a hosted version, allowing RTrade to take care of all the hard work in maintaining the necessary infrastructure, while you get to make beautiful applications using our API, which abstracts away all the nitty gritty details, and complications that come from using the new generation of storage protocols.


Technologies that will be supported by our cloud storage, and API:
* Public IPFS (current)
* Private IPFS (planned)
* Ethereum Swarm (planned)
* STORJ (planned)
* SIA (planned)


# Goals

* Provide an easy to use interface with IPFS for both personal and business purposes.
* Introduce IPFS to people who may have otherwise not been able to use the technology
* Educate about decentralized and distributed storage technologies
* Provide an easy-to-use API for different decentralized and distributed storage technologies

# Data Privacy

This is a huge issue and concern for any form of cloud storage. But is seldom mentioned by any of the projects promising revolutionary storage systems, global in scope. They'll talk about all the technical benefits, and features of their storage solutions which use IPFS, but data privacy isn't discussed. Data privacy is an extreme focus of RTrade, and we will not be releasing Temporal until we are absolutely certain that all data privacy laws we need to abide by, are met. This is currently one of our primary areas of focus.

# How're We Different

We aren't doing an ICO,  and we're not wasting our development efforts on redesigning the wheel with some new fangled storage protocol, and blockchain solution. Although we're using bleeding edge technology, we're commited to using names, and open source software that is already tested, and that has a thriving development community behind them. And finally, results matter; It is far to common in this space for companies to ask you to hand over your hand earned cash on the fleeting promise that it will lead to something, but that something is either never delivered, or extremely lack in features, and is not the original idea which was sold.

# Tips and Tricks

When running IPFS, since we specify a non-standard path for the IPFS repo, you must configure the proper repo environment path BEFORE running any service depending on IPFS
