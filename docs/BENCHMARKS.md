# Adding 880MB File To IPFS

## Test 1 - VPN - No Direct

This test was done with the IPFS node connected to the router via ethernet. 
I'm testing off of my personal laptop, connected via wifi to a 5Ghz router, along with using a VPN connection to the node, adding extra processing.

Total request time was 2m58s as can be seen below:
