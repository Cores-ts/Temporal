# ROADMAP

# Immediate release 

## Paid For Pinning Service

This will allow people to ensure that their content hashes remain pinned for as long as they want (currently we have a 5 year upper limit, with intervals of 1 month).

## File Storage Backed By IPFS

If you have file that you wish to be backed up to Temporal, you can upload single files, large files, tarballs, etc..  which you can rest assured will be safely backed up by our IPFS nodes and clusters, ensuring you can download your file at any time, and always have it pinned.

What's the difference between this, and the paid for pinning service? Well, the paid for pinning service is useful if you already have uploaded your content and want another source to pin it, but what if you haven't uploaded your content to IPFS yet? This will allow you to simultaneously backup your files with Temporal, but also ensure that it's available to yourself, and the rest of the IPFS network should you wish to distribute the content hash.
